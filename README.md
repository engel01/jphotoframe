# JPhotoFrame v0.3.1

JPhotoFrame is a simple Java application for displaying a collection of photos in a full-screen slideshow. It is meant to be used when creating a DIY photo frame.

## Features

* Lightweight and easily configurable
* Generates cached (resampled) images automatically
* Current date/time display with custom date/time formats
* Adjustable text font sizes
* Fills in the background on vertical photos using the photo as the source
* Weather forecast using OpenWeatherMap
* Pausable operation i.e. during photo frame offline hours
* Image rotation correction utility

## Issues Fixed

* Bug #1 OutOfMemoryError when loading image stops images from cycling
* OWM weather information not shown due to 2.1 API removal

## Screenshots

## Building

Use Maven to build.

``mvn clean package``

## Configuration

Configuration is simple. Add a file called *config.properties* into the same directory as the jar file. Below is a sample configuration file (note that you will need a valid OWM API key to get weather data).

```
screenNumber=0
imageDirectory=/photos
cacheDirectory=/photos/cache
imageTimeout=300000
fontName=Verdana
fontSizeDate=20
fontSizeTime=50
dateFormat=MMM d yyyy
timeFormat=H:mm
dateOffsetX=15
dateOffsetY=10
timeOffsetX=10
timeOffsetY=30
textColor=0,0,0
textOutlineColor=255,0,0
textOutlineOffset=2
backgroundSourcePercent=0.01
backgroundOpacity=0.2
showWeather=true
weatherCity=Brisbane,AU
owmApiKey=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

You can specify a custom configuration file to load by using a command line argument, simply give the location of the custom config file to the *run.sh* script or when running the *java* command. See how to run below.

## Running

To run, launch the jar file like so:

`java -Xms32m -Xmx32m -jar jphotoframe.jar`

Alternatively copy the *jphotoframe.jar* file to the same directory as the *run.sh* (after building using ant) and execute the *run.sh* script instead.

Make sure that there is a *lib* directory with the *slf4j-api-1.7.2.jar* and *yahoo-weather-java-api-1.2.0.jar* files
inside it. The directory structure should look like this:

```
+-- lib/
|   +-- json-20170516.jar
|   +-- owm-japis-2.5.0.5.jar
|   +-- mediautil-1.0-withfixes.jar
+-- jphotoframe.jar
```

The jar files from the lib directory are included in the jphotoframe.jar file manifest and should be picked up
automatically.

## Weather Forecasts

Weather is retrieved from OpenWeatherMap using this library: https://github.com/akapribot/OWM-JAPIs

All weather conditions are displayed using Weather Icons (http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/).

## Pausable Operation

The time and photo updates can be paused by creating a file called *pause.txt* in the photos directory. If this file is found, the photo frame will become idle until that file is removed again.
This is useful to suspend photo updates during photo frame offline hours i.e. during the night.

## Scheduled Tasks

There is a script provided along with the source code called *onoff.sh* that can be used to control when the screen is turned on and off using *xset*. This script also controls whether the pausible operation is enabled or not.

To use make sure the *onoff_times.txt* file sets relevant times for when your screen should be on or off. The format of the file is the hour (24 hour format) followed by a tab, then either the word 'on' or 'off'.

The default file is as follows:

```
00	off
01	off
02	off
03	off
04	off
05	off
06	on
07	on
08	on
09	on
10	on
11	on
12	on
13	on
14	on
15	on
16	on
17	on
18	on
19	on
20	on
21	on
22	off
23	off
```

Update the *onoff.sh* script to set the correct directories and display number.

Set your crontab to below (update paths as required):

```
0 * * * * bash /home/pi/jphotoframe/onoff.sh
```

## Image Rotation Correction Utility

Sometimes JPEG files have rotation information saved into them. JPhotoFrame uses the standard Java JPEG loader and doesn't try to auto-orient images after loading. This can result in incorrectly rotated images.

A utility is provided to pre-process all of your photos and re-orinent them. This is done with the help of the mediautil library (http://mediachest.sourceforge.net/mediautil/).

To use this utility, run the *fixrotation.sh* script or pass the *-fixrotation* parameter when running JPhotoFrame manually. This utility expect a command line argument specifying the photo directory name.
